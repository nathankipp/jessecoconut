/*
this works, but should be all wrapped into one declaration:
body {
    background-color: black,
    color: white
}
also, this code should have been added to the css/main.css file, not done in <style> tags.
css files should be linked at the top (see line 10, above), and then their declarations
will apply to the whole document.  it keeps your HTML and CSS separate!

    <!-- it's nit-picky, but it's a good habit to format code w/ regular indenting
    so it's easier to tell where closing elements match their opener.
    you can't tell the difference when you see the page, but the code is cleaner
    and easier to edit if you decide to make changes
    like this:

    <!-- the image can't be seen b/c the writing is black and the page is black!
    can you make the background of the containing div white instead?
    can you do it by putting the code in the css/main.css file instead of in this file?
